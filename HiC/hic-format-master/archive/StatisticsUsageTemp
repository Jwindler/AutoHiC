# Statistics Overview 
Program to calculate statistics on the infile. The infile should be the
"intermediate" form: no duplicates, 14 fields, laid out as:

str1 chr1 pos1 frag1 str2 chr2 pos2 frag2 mapq1 cigar1 seq1 mapq2 cigar2 seq2

This intermediate form makes it easy to sort (to remove duplicates) and to
grab just the first six fields to create the HiC map.

The last six fields are needed for this statistics scripts, in order to
determine the histogram of mapQ values, the number of dangling ends, and the
number of ligation junctions. Cigar is needed to properly calculate dups.

The program also requires a restriction site file, which lists on
each line, the sorted locations of the restriction sites.

The program will print out the total reads, # dangling ends, # ligation
junctions, #intra vs inter chromosomal reads, # inner/outer/right/left
read pairs, a histogram of the MAPQ values, a histogram of the distance
from the closest restriction enzyme site, and a count of which end was closest to the
restriction enzyme site.

#Detailed Usage

```
statistics [--ligation NNNN] [--mapqs mapq1,maqp2] [--mndindex mnd] [--threads thr] 
           <site file> <stats file> <infile> <genome ID> [stats file 2] [outfile] 
```
The required arguments are: 
* `<site file>`: list of HindIII restriction sites, one line per chromosome
* `<stats file>`: output file containing total reads, for library complexity
* `<infile>`: file in intermediate format to calculate statistics on
* `<genome ID>: `: file to create chromosome handler

Optional Flags: 
* `--ligation`: ligation junction, default is "GATCGATC"
* `--mapqs`: mapping quality thresholds, can pass 0,1, or 2 values, default values are 1 and 30* 
(30 is used as default only if two separate stats files are passed)
* `--mndindex`: for multithreading purposes, file of all positions within input file
* `--threads`: for multithreading purposes, number of threads to be used by system

Optional Arguments: 
* `[stats file 2]`: second output file containing total reads for second mapping quality value
* `[outfile]`: TBA 

#Examples
`statistics --ligation AG --mapqs 1,2 --mndindex mndindex.txt --threads 4 sitefile.txt statsfile.txt statsfile2.txt inputfile.txt
genomeID.txt`

This command will run statistics calculations for multithreaded systems with two mapping quality values.

`statistics --ligation AG --mapqs 1 --mndindex mndindex.txt --threads 4 sitefile.txt statsfile.txt statsfile2.txt inputfile.txt genomeID.txt`

This command will run statistics calculations for multithreaded systems with one mapping quality value.

`statistics --ligation AG --mapqs 1,2 sitefile.txt statsfile.txt statsfile2.txt inputfile.txt genomeID.txt`

This command will run statistics calculations for single threaded systems with two mapping quality values. 

`statistics --ligation AG --mapqs 1 sitefile.txt statsfile.txt inputfile.txt genomeID.txt`

This command will run statistics calculations for single threaded systems with one mapping quality value.
